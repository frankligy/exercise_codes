# change the theme: open ~/.bash_profile(get executed when you are logged in) or ~/.bash_rc(everytime you open a new terminmal window, you should 
# modify /.bash_rc on cluster, mac should modify /.bash_profile), add the following to said files.

export LSCOLORS=GxFxCxDxBxegedabagaced (each two pairs – text color and bc color; 11 pairs In total representing 11 types of files)​
