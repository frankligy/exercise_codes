### debug
# 1. in where R is installed, there's a Makeconf file can be editted (/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Resources/etc/Makeconf)
#    to configure the path to the gcc, clang, gfortran compiler.
# 2. we can potentially create a file called ~/.R/Makevars to overwrite the setting in Makeconf, no guarantee will work
# 3. install gfortran or other compilers (https://mac.r-project.org/tools/), add it to the path
